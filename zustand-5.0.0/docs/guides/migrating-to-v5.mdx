# How to Migrate to v5 from v4

We highly recommend to update to the latest version of v4, before migrating to v5. It will show all deprecation warnings without breaking your app.

## Changes in v5

- Drop default exports
- Drop deprecated features
- Make React 18 the minimum required version
- Make use-sync-external-store a peer dependency (required for `createWithEqualityFn` and `useStoreWithEqualityFn` in `zustand/traditional`)
- Make TypeScript 4.5 the minimum required version
- Drop UMD/SystemJS support
- Organize entry points in the package.json
- Drop ES5 support
- Other small improvements (technically breaking changes)

## Migration Guide

### `createWithEqualityFn`

The `create` function in v5 does not support customizing equality function.

If you use custom equality function such as `shallow`,
the easiest migration is to use `createWithEqualityFn`.

```js
// v4
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { shallow } from 'zustand/shallow'

const useCountStore = create((set) => ({
  count: 0,
  text: 'hello',
  // ...
}))

const Component = () => {
  const { count, text } = useCountStore(
    (state) => ({
      count: state.count,
      text: state.text,
    }),
    shallow,
  )
  // ...
}
```

That can be done with `createWithEqualityFn` in v5:

```bash
npm install use-sync-external-store
```

```js
// v5
import { createWithEqualityFn as create } from 'zustand/traditional'

// The rest is the same as v4
```

Alternatively, for the `shallow` use case, you can use `useShallow` hook:

```js
// v5
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { useShallow } from 'zustand/shallow'

const useCountStore = create((set) => ({
  count: 0,
  text: 'hello',
  // ...
}))

const Component = () => {
  const { count, text } = useCountStore(
    useShallow((state) => ({
      count: state.count,
      text: state.text,
    })),
  )
  // ...
}
```
